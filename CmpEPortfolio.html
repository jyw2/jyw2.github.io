        <h2>FIGHTING GAME INPUT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>This work shows a full breakdown of my development process</p>
        <p>I wanted to solve a problem: <br> How do 2d fighters (like street fighter) interpert 
        directional inputs from the player
         like down-left-right-punch and turn them into fireballs? 
         <br> <a href="https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Inputs" target = "_blank">Background information on fighting game commands </a></p>
         
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/Streetfighter.jpg" alt="">

        <p>I began by planning what the system would need. Other than the basic task of
            correctly reading the inputs, the system would also have to:<br>
            <br> 1. Only read inputs from a set number of seconds. <br>2. Excecute the special move even if the inputs are slightly wrong.
             <br> 3. Control which special move is excecuted if two different patterns are inputted within the time frame.
             <br>4. Not excecute a special move twice by accident.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img1.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Next, I brainstormed what data structures to use to store the inputs.
            Removing from the beginning of a normal array and shifting would cause a very large big O time, so that was not an option.
            A hashmap did not have the order that I needed.
            A linked list would work, but another idea I had seen in a midterm exam question proved better.</p>
        <p>
            The idea was: an array that itself did not shift, but what you considered the end and beginning of the array did.
            I stored the newest input in the array at the index held in the variable end. 
            The oldest input would be in the array at the index held in the variable beg. 
            Whenever an input was added, it would replace the value at index beg and the two indeces would shift right one.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img2.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>
            I continued planning by figuring out how to solve each of the aformentioned
            additional requirements.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img3.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            For requirement 1, (Set input time frames for the player) I decided to 
            remove the oldest input every few milliseconds. This was done by
            adding an input to the array that would not be recognized as valid (None).
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img3.1.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            To complete requirement 2, (allow slightly off commands) I used a "checklist" system when reading the array for valid special move commands.
            Each special move had a "checklist" of inputs it needed to see before it could be excecuted. Each time an input
            on the checklist was seen, it would be "checked". <br><br>
            An input on the checklist could not be checked until all previous inputs on the checklist had already been checked. 
            This ensured the order of the command was correct while also allowing incorrect inputs to be inbetween the correct ones.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img 3.2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            For requirement 3 (dont excecute two commands), I simply placed a priority system for each special move. If two moves were read from the array at once,
            only the higher priority move would excecute.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img3.3.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            To solve requirement 4 (only excecute a command once), I removed all 
            inputs from the array and replaced them with None objects after any special move was found.
        </p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p>
            Next, I rounded out the planning stage with a general class outline.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img4.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            After That I created some pseudo code.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img4.1.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img4.2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Finally, after multiple refactors, the code below was created. I used Python 3 for the implementation.
           Note: the implementation uses numpad fighting game notation, where each direction
           is represented by a number. For more info click 
            <a href="http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/Notation" target = "_blank">here.</a>
         <br>   The implemented code stores any special move as a class-
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            and the array( or stream ) as it's own class.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img6.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It holds all the inputs in an array, and has a distinct beginning(the oldest
            input) and end (the most recent input) 
            index. When an input is added, it is placed at the index of the beginning, replacing
            the previous value. <br><br> The end and beg indeces are then shifted one to the right, which
            shifts the new input to the end index and the oldest input to the beg index.
            The beg and end indeces will also wrap back around to the left once they reach the end of the array.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img7.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The array will also replace the oldest input with an empty
            input every few milliseconds. This creates the timing window for
            the command to be excecuted by the player.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.1.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The array and all special moves are held in a stream reader class.</p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img9.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It looks for inputs when triggered by checking each input in the array against
            the specific codes stored in each CMD (special move) class. If an input matches
            the current targeted character in the code, the targeted code is shifted over or "checked". 
            Once the whole code has been checked for a CMD, it is added to a list of
            found CMDS. <br><br> This way of "checklisting" the required codes allows the player to
            input a slightly off code (such as down-up-right-left-punch where down-right-punch
            is the code) and still get the desired special move.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img10.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The reader then checks for the priority of each code before outputing 
            the highest priority and most recent special move. This prevents the reader from outputting two
            special moves on the same read.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img11.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The array is then flushed to prevent the reader from reading the same array information twice
            (which can result in unwanted specials being read) </p>
            <img src="assets/inputsystem/img12.JPG" alt="">

        
        <p>
            
            The resulting program works as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div id = "input_results">
            <video src="assets/inputsystem/inputsytemoutput.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>
           
            <ul>
                <li>First, the program Works as intended for all 3 codes.</li>
                <li> Second, Input was down-up-right-downright-punch 
                    where the code needed was down-downright-right-punch. Fireball is still detected.</li>
                <li> Third, fireball and dragon punch both inputed, but ONLY dragon punch 
                    is outputed as it has higher priority. </li>
                <li>Lastly the timing window for inputting the whole code was passed,
                    so no output is produced.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Maya Python Programs</h2>

        <p>The following program I developed generates a Poly shape chain of links in Maya 2020. 
            you can choose the number of links, the length of the links and the thickness of the links.
            The slider mins and maxes dynamically change to prevent the links from clipping. The links
            are parented to the first link and renamed. A video demonstration can be seen below.
            
            
        </p>

        <video src="assets/Development Videos/2021-01-17 13-55-34.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>

        <p>This program uses a window class which first creates the UI.
             This window also has an associated Chain class object. </p>
             <img src="assets/MayaP_images/1.JPG" alt="">


        <p>The chain object has associated ring class objects stored in an array. The
            first (root chain) remains at index 0 at all times.</p>
            <img src="assets/MayaP_images/2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The rectangular links(rings) are created from a torus shape that has four slightly stretched loops.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/3.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Every link is moved based on it's position in the chain and its 2 radi.
             The function that determines this distance is: 
             RingPosition*(ringRadius+(ringRadius - Thickness of a ring)). 
            Each link is also renamed and parented to the root ring.  
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/4.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Whenever the slider is changed, the old chain is deleted and a new chain is created. This is quicky excecuted by deleting the root link and instancing a new Chain class. While the overhead
            may be larger using this strategy VS moving and resizing each link, the implementation is much simpler and more clear. This allows for easier changes, troubleshooting, and teaching. I also reasoned that this program would not be used
            during a runtime of a game, so it's overhead would have less precedence over clarity.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Changing one of the radius or link radius effects the other's maxes/mins. 
            This is to prevent the links from colliding and clipping through each other.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/6.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/6.5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The cancel button deletes the current root link, removing the chain of poly objects.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/7.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Confirming simply closes the UI window, leaving the chain to be used.
