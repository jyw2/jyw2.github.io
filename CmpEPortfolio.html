        <h1>Development</h1>

        <h2>Maya Python Programs</h2>

        <p>The following program I developed generates a Poly shape chain of links in Maya 2020. 
            you can choose the number of links, the length of the links and the thickness of the links.
            The slider mins and maxes dynamically change to prevent the links from clipping. The links
            are parented to the first link and renamed. A video demonstration can be seen below.
            
            
        </p>

        <video src="assets/Development Videos/2021-01-17 13-55-34.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>

        <p>This program uses a window class which first creates the UI.
             This window also has an associated Chain class object. </p>
             <img src="assets/MayaP_images/1.JPG" alt="">


        <p>The chain object has associated ring class objects stored in an array. The
            first (root chain) remains at index 0 at all times.</p>
            <img src="assets/MayaP_images/2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The links are created from a torus shape that has modified subdivisions and edges.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/3.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Every link is moved based on it's position in the chain and its 2 radi.
            Each link is also renamed and parented to the root ring.  
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/4.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Whenever the slider is changed, the old chain is deleted and a new chain is created. This is quicky excecuted by deleting the root link and instancing a new Chain class. While the overhead
            may be larger using this strategy VS moving and resizing each link, the implementation is much simpler and more clear. This allows for easier changes, troubleshooting, and teaching. I also reasoned that this program would not be used
            during a runtime of a game, so it's overhead would have less precedence over clarity.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Changing one of the radius or link radius effects the other's maxes/mins. 
            This is to prevent the links form colliding and clipping through each other.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/6.5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The cancel button deletes the current root link, removing the chain of poly objects.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/MayaP_images/7.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            Confirming simply closes the UI window, leaving the chain to be used.

        <h2>FIGHTING GAME INPUT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>I wanted to solve a problem: How do 2d fighters (like street fighter) interpert 
        commands like down-left-right-punch and turn them into fireballs? <br> <a href="https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Inputs" target = "_blank">Background information on fighting game commands </a></p>
         
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/Streetfighter.jpg" alt="">

        <p>I began by planning what the system would need. other than the basic task of
            correctly reading the input, it would also have to use a set time frame, include 
            leniency for wrong inputs and prevent input conflicts.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img1.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Next, I came up with the general idea for how to store the inputs. My solution: 
            a cyclical array. 
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img2.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>
            I continued planning by figuring out how to solve each of the aformentioned
            additional requirements.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img3.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Finally, I rounded out the planning stage with a general class outline. I used Python 3 for the implementation.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img4.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
           Note: the implementation uses numpad fighting game notation, more info 
            <a href="http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/Notation" target = "_blank">here.</a>
            The implemented code stores any special move as a class-
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            and the stream as it's own class.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img6.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It holds all the inputs in an array, and has a distinct beginning(the oldest
            input) and end (the most recent input) 
            index. When an input is added, it is placed at the index of the beginning, replacing
            the previous value. The end and beg indeces are then shifted one to the right, which
            shifts the new input to the end index and the oldest input to the beg index.
            The beg and end indeces will also wrap back around to the left once they reach the end of the array.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img7.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The stream will also replace the oldest input with an empty
            input every few milliseconds. This creates the timing window for
            the command to be excecuted by the player.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.1.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The stream and all special moves are held in a stream reader class.</p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img9.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It looks for inputs when triggered by checking each input in the stream against
            the specific codes stored in each CMD (special move) class. If an input matches
            the current targeted character in the code, the targeted code is shifted over or "checked". 
            Once the whole code has been checked for a CMD, it is added to a list of
            found CMDS. This way of "checklisting" the required codes allows the player to
            input a slightly off code (such as down-up-right-left-punch where down-right-punch
            is the code) and still get the desired special move.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img10.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The reader then checks for the priority of each code before outputing 
            the highest priority and most recent special move. This prevents the reader from outputting two
            special moves on the same read.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img11.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The Stream is then flushed to prevent the reader from reading the same stream information twice
            (which can result in unwanted specials being read) </p>
            <img src="assets/inputsystem/img12.JPG" alt="">

        
        <p>
            
            The resulting program works as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div id = "input_results">
            <video src="assets/inputsystem/inputsytemoutput.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>
           
            <ul>
                <li>First, the program Works as intended for all 3 codes.</li>
                <li> Second, Input was down-up-right-downright-punch 
                    where the code needed was down-downright-right-punch. Fireball is still detected.</li>
                <li> Third, fireball and dragon punch both inputed, but ONLY dragon punch 
                    is outputed as it has higher priority. </li>
                <li>Lastly the timing window for inputting the whole code was passed,
                    so no output is produced.</li>
            </ul>
