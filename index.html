        <h2>Fighting Game Input System</h2>
        <p>Problem: How do 2d fighters interpert 
        commands like down-left-right-punch and turn them into fireballs?</p>

        <p>I began by planning what the system would need. other than the basic task of
            correctly reading the input, it would also have to use a set time frame, include 
            leniency for wrong inputs and prevent input conflicts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, I came up with the general idea for how to store the inputs. My solution: 
            a cyclical array. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I continued planning by figuring out how to solve each of the aformentioned
            additional requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, I rounded out the planning stage with a general class outline.
        </p>

        <p>
            The implemented code stores any special move as a class-
        </p>

        <p>
            and the stream as it's own class.
        </p>

        <p>
            It holds all the inputs in an array, and has a distinct beginning(the oldest
            input) and end (the most recent input) 
            index. When an input is added, it is placed at the index of the beginning, replacing
            the previous value. The end and beg indeces are then shifted one to the right, which
            shifts the new input to the end index and the oldest input to the beg index.
            The indeces will also wrap back around to the left once the reach the end of the array.
        </p>

        <p>The stream and all special moves are held in a stream reader class.</p>

        <p>
            It looks for inputs when triggered by checking each input in the stream against
            the specific codes stored in each CMD (special move) class. 
        </p>
