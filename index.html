        <h2>2D Fighting Pipeline Development</h2>

        <h3>During the time I lead a small team of four in the development of a 2D fighting game,
            I had the oppurtunity to develop and smooth out many pipelines and templates to connect my
        artists and programmers. </h3>

        <p> To assist the creation of animation, I created and broke down the important animations needed for 
            every character.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I created a workflow for my artists to follow to go from idea to implementable animation. 
            To do this I created templates for animation frames to keep consistant proportions and perspective.
            I determined that 2048x2048 was the optimum size for sprites to retain quality while keeping file size lower. 
            These templates were created through extensive research in the strategies of other fighting games.
        </p>

        <p>
            The workflow conisted of roughing the animation keys in the template files, then painting tones
            directly in black and white for inbetweens and keys, and finally outlining the edge for each frame. 
            We would then export each image as a TGA file. 
        </p>



        <p>
            I also created and taught my artists to use a color pallete and non-antiailising workflow.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to keep a consistant style, I created reference sheets to draw from.
        </p>

        <h2>FIGHTING GAME INPUT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>I wanted to solve a problem: How do 2d fighters (like street fighter) interpert 
        commands like down-left-right-punch and turn them into fireballs?</p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/Streetfighter.jpg" alt="">

        <p>I began by planning what the system would need. other than the basic task of
            correctly reading the input, it would also have to use a set time frame, include 
            leniency for wrong inputs and prevent input conflicts.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img1.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Next, I came up with the general idea for how to store the inputs. My solution: 
            a cyclical array. 
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img2.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>
            I continued planning by figuring out how to solve each of the aformentioned
            additional requirements.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img3.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Finally, I rounded out the planning stage with a general class outline.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img4.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
           Note: the implementation uses numpad fighting game notation, more info 
            <a href="http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/Notation">here.</a>
            The implemented code stores any special move as a class-
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            and the stream as it's own class.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img6.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It holds all the inputs in an array, and has a distinct beginning(the oldest
            input) and end (the most recent input) 
            index. When an input is added, it is placed at the index of the beginning, replacing
            the previous value. The end and beg indeces are then shifted one to the right, which
            shifts the new input to the end index and the oldest input to the beg index.
            The beg and end indeces will also wrap back around to the left once the reach the end of the array.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img7.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The stream will also replace the oldest input with an empty
            input every few milliseconds. This creates the timing window for
            the command to be excecuted by the player.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.1.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The stream and all special moves are held in a stream reader class.</p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img9.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It looks for inputs when triggered by checking each input in the stream against
            the specific codes stored in each CMD (special move) class. If an input matches
            the current targeted character in the code, the targeted code is shifted over or "checked". 
            Once the whole code has been checked for a CMD, it is added to a list of
            found CMDS. This way of "checklisting" the required codes allows the player to
            input a slightly off code (such as down-up-right-left-punch where down-right-punch
            is the code) and still get the desired special move.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img10.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The reader then checks for the priority of each code before outputing 
            the highest priority and most recent special move. This prevents the reader from outputting two
            special moves on the same read.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img11.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The Stream is then flushed to prevent the reader from reading the same stream information twice
            (which can result in unwanted specials being read) </p>
            <img src="assets/inputsystem/img12.JPG" alt="">

        
        <p>
            
            The resulting program works as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div id = "input_results">
            <video src="assets/inputsystem/inputsytemoutput.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>
           
            <ul>
                <li>First, the program Works as intended for all 3 codes.</li>
                <li> Secondly, Input was down-up-right-downright-punch 
                    where the code needed was down-downright-right-punch. Fireball is still detected.</li>
                <li> Third, fireball and dragon punch both inputed, but ONLY dragon punch 
                    is outputed as it has higher priority. </li>
                <li>Lastly the timing window for inputting the whole code was passed,
                    so no output is produced.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>2D Fighting Game Pallete Development</h2>

        <h3>While developing a 2d fighting game in unreal engine 4, 
            I wanted to create a pallete switching system. I knew recoloring every frame was
        not an option if I wanted a gamut of palletes, so I needed a better solution.</h3>

        <p>I had a vague premonition to use textures, but nothing solid, so I went searching.</p>

        <p>
            Looking for the code in older games such as street fighter 3 and king of 
            fighters proved difficult. This was because most of the source codes of these
            games where still un-obtainable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually, I learned that the game "Skullgirls" used agradient based color replacement system for switching.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>With more research and by parusing through forums, I discovered a way
            to replace a BNW gradient an with associated Color gradient. It did so by
            mapping the specific pixel of shade on one BNW refernce texture to the colored
            pixel on the colored reference gradient with the same x value. Using this map, it would replace any 
            shade in the image with that specific value to the mapped color. 
        </p>

        <p>This however, was not exactly what I was looking for. Since I was using cell shaded
            sprites, I needed only to use a few distinct shades. So to use this system for palletes,
            I created two large textures, one colored and one black and white with large colored blocks
            instead of gradients. This way, even if there was a bit of error on mapping, I would always get the 
            desired pallete. 
        </p> -->

        <p>
            Using this system lead to some issues with anti-aliasing and image transforms (as they would cause shades that 
            were not in the reference texture to appear), but they where solved by using "nearest neighbor transforms"
            and removing all image compression and anti-aliasing. 
        </p>

        <p>The result was a pallete system that allowed for a new pallete for each color texture produced.</p>
