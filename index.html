        <h2>2D Fighter Pipeline Development</h2>

        <h3> I had the oppurtunity to lead a small team of four in the development of a 2D fighting game in Unreal Engine 4.
            During that time, I developed many pipelines and templates to connect my
        artists and programmers. </h3>
        <img src="assets/fighter/Intro.png" alt="">

        <p> To assist the creation of animations, I synthesized and broke down the important animations needed for 
            every character.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/fighter/breakdowns.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>
            I also created an animation workflow and templates for my artists to follow.
            To do this I created templates for animation frames to keep consistant proportions and perspective.
            I determined that 2048x2048 was the optimum size for sprites to retain quality while keeping file size low. 
            <br>Note: The background image used for screen size reference is not created by me, it is from the game: "Guilty Gear XRD Rev2"
            
        </p><img src="assets/fighter/Animationbase.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="assets/fighter/Backgroundsizetmplate.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            These templates were created through extensive research in the strategies of other fighting games.
            <span class = "subtext"> Images taken from: Street fighter 3rd strike, Under Night In Birth, Skullgirls,
                 King of Fighters and Blazblue</span>
        </p>
        <img src="assets/fighter/Research.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            The workflow conisted of roughing the animation keys in the template files, then painting tones
            directly in black and white for inbetweens and keys, and finally outlining the edge for each frame. 
            We would then export each unique frame as a TGA file. The images were then proccessed into Unreal engine
            "flipbooks" for runtime. Frames that ran for more than one FPS frame had timing manually changed
            in engine to prevent the creation of multiple duplicate frames in storage.
            The programs used included: Photoshop, Clipstudio and Krita.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/fighter/Workflow.jpg" alt="">



        <p>
            I also taught my artists to use a color pallete system and non-antiailising workflow.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/fighter/Color_grey_diant.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="assets/fighter/ref.png" alt="">

        <p>
            The pallete system worked by
        mapping the specific pixel of shade on one black and white reference pallete to the colored
        pixel on the colored reference pallete with the same x value. Using this map, it would replace any 
        shade in the material with that specific value to the mapped color. A demonstration can be viewed below.
        The method was mainly derived from 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/6bkjnn/how_can_i_palette_swap_in_a_material/">a forum post</a>

        <p>
            In order to keep a consistant style, I created reference sheets to draw from.

        <h2>Maya Python Programs</h2>

        <p>The following program I developed generates a Poly shape chain of links in Maya 2020. 
            you can choose the number of links, the length of the links and the thickness of the links.
            The slider mins and maxes dynamically change to prevent the links from clipping. The links
            are parented to the first link and renamed. A video demonstration can be seen below.
            <a href="https://github.com/jyw2/Maya-Python-Programs" target = "_blank">Project Repository</a>
            
        </p>

        <video src="assets/Development Videos/2021-01-17 13-55-34.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>

        <p>This program uses a window class which first creates the UI.
             This window also has an associated Chain class object. </p>


        <p>The chain object has associated ring class objects stored in an array. The
            first (root chain) remains at index 0 at all times.</p>

        <p>The links are created from a torus shape that has modified subdivisions and edges.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every link is moved based on it's position in the chain and its 2 radi.
            Each link is also renamed and parented to the root ring.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever the slider is changed, the old chain is deleted and a new chain is created. This is quicky excecuted by deleting the root link and instancing a new Chain class. While the overhead
            may be larger using this strategy VS moving and resizing each link, the implementation is much simpler and more clear. This allows for easier changes, troubleshooting, and teaching. I also reasoned that this program would not be used
            during a runtime of a game, so it's overhead would have less precedence over clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Changing one of the radius or link radius effects the other's maxes/mins. 
            This is to prevent the links form colliding and clipping through each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cancel button deletes the current root link, removing the chain of poly objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Confirming simply closes the UI window, leaving the chain to be used.

        <h2>FIGHTING GAME INPUT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>I wanted to solve a problem: How do 2d fighters (like street fighter) interpert 
        commands like down-left-right-punch and turn them into fireballs?</p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/Streetfighter.jpg" alt="">

        <p>I began by planning what the system would need. other than the basic task of
            correctly reading the input, it would also have to use a set time frame, include 
            leniency for wrong inputs and prevent input conflicts.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img1.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Next, I came up with the general idea for how to store the inputs. My solution: 
            a cyclical array. 
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img2.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>
            I continued planning by figuring out how to solve each of the aformentioned
            additional requirements.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img3.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Finally, I rounded out the planning stage with a general class outline. I used Python 3 for the implementation.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img4.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
           Note: the implementation uses numpad fighting game notation, more info 
            <a href="http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/Notation" target = "_blank">here.</a>
            The implemented code stores any special move as a class-
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            and the stream as it's own class.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img6.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It holds all the inputs in an array, and has a distinct beginning(the oldest
            input) and end (the most recent input) 
            index. When an input is added, it is placed at the index of the beginning, replacing
            the previous value. The end and beg indeces are then shifted one to the right, which
            shifts the new input to the end index and the oldest input to the beg index.
            The beg and end indeces will also wrap back around to the left once they reach the end of the array.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img7.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The stream will also replace the oldest input with an empty
            input every few milliseconds. This creates the timing window for
            the command to be excecuted by the player.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.1.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The stream and all special moves are held in a stream reader class.</p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img9.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It looks for inputs when triggered by checking each input in the stream against
            the specific codes stored in each CMD (special move) class. If an input matches
            the current targeted character in the code, the targeted code is shifted over or "checked". 
            Once the whole code has been checked for a CMD, it is added to a list of
            found CMDS. This way of "checklisting" the required codes allows the player to
            input a slightly off code (such as down-up-right-left-punch where down-right-punch
            is the code) and still get the desired special move.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img10.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The reader then checks for the priority of each code before outputing 
            the highest priority and most recent special move. This prevents the reader from outputting two
            special moves on the same read.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img11.JPG" alt="">

        <p>The Stream is then flushed to prevent the reader from reading the same stream information twice
            (which can result in unwanted specials being read) </p>
            <img src="assets/inputsystem/img12.JPG" alt="">

        
        <p>
            
            The resulting program works as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div id = "input_results">
            <video src="assets/inputsystem/inputsytemoutput.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>
           
            <ul>
                <li>First, the program Works as intended for all 3 codes.</li>
                <li> Second, Input was down-up-right-downright-punch 
                    where the code needed was down-downright-right-punch. Fireball is still detected.</li>
                <li> Third, fireball and dragon punch both inputed, but ONLY dragon punch 
                    is outputed as it has higher priority. </li>
                <li>Lastly the timing window for inputting the whole code was passed,
                    so no output is produced.</li>
            </ul>
