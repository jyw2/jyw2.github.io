        <h2>FIGHTING GAME INPUT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>Problem: How do 2d fighters interpert 
        commands like down-left-right-punch and turn them into fireballs?</p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img1.jpg" alt="">

        <p>I began by planning what the system would need. other than the basic task of
            correctly reading the input, it would also have to use a set time frame, include 
            leniency for wrong inputs and prevent input conflicts.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img2.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Next, I came up with the general idea for how to store the inputs. My solution: 
            a cyclical array. 
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img3.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>
            I continued planning by figuring out how to solve each of the aformentioned
            additional requirements.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img4.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            Finally, I rounded out the planning stage with a general class outline.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img5.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The implemented code stores any special move as a class-
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img6.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            and the stream as it's own class.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img7.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            It holds all the inputs in an array, and has a distinct beginning(the oldest
            input) and end (the most recent input) 
            index. When an input is added, it is placed at the index of the beginning, replacing
            the previous value. The end and beg indeces are then shifted one to the right, which
            shifts the new input to the end index and the oldest input to the beg index.
            The beg and end indeces will also wrap back around to the left once the reach the end of the array.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.1.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="assets/inputsystem/img8.2.JPG" alt="">

        <p>
            The stream will also replace the oldest input with an empty
            input every few milliseconds. This creates the timing window for
            the command to be excecuted by the player.
        </p>

        <p>The stream and all special moves are held in a stream reader class.</p>

        <p>
            It looks for inputs when triggered by checking each input in the stream against
            the specific codes stored in each CMD (special move) class. If an input matches
            the current targeted character in the code, the targeted code is shifted over or "checked". 
            Once the whole code has been checked for a CMD, it is added to a list of
            found CMDS. This way of "checklisting" the required codes allows the player to
            input a slightly off code (such as down-up-right-left-punch where down-right-punch
            is the code) and still get the desired special move.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reader then checks for the priority of each code before outputing 
            the highest priority and most recent special move. This prevents the reader from outputting two
            special moves on the same read.
        </p>

        <p>The Stream is then flushed to prevent the reader from reading the same stream information twice
            (which can result in unwanted specials being read) </p>

        
        <p>
            The resulting program works as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div id = "input_results">
            <video src="assets/inputsytem/inputsytemoutput.mp4"></video>
           
            <p> First, the program Works as intended for all 3 codes.
                Secondly, Input was down-up-right-downright-punch where the code needed was down-downright-right-punch. 
                Fireball is still detected. Third, fireball and dragon punch both inputed, but ONLY dragon punch 
                is outputed as it has higher priority. Lastly the timing window for inputting the whole code was passed,
                so no output is produced.</p>
            
        </div>
