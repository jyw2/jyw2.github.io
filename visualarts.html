        <h2>Concept art</h2>

        <p>For a few of my projects I produced concept art to illustrate 
            visual ideas with an emphasis on the speed of production. </p>

        <h2>Animation & 3D</h2>
            <p>
                This is a render of a mecha head poly modeled in Maya. The skydome hdri image is from <a href="https://hdrihaven.com/hdri/?c=outdoor&h=lilienstein">here.</a>

            <p>The following videos were created using both After Effects and Live2D( a 2D rigging and modeling software)</p>
            <video src="assets/animationand3d/Wow.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>
            <video src="assets/animationand3d/IndraAN.mp4" type = "video/mp4" controls></video>
           

        
        <h2>Character Design</h2>
        <p> My design process is based on repeated itereation. It seperates color from shape to maintain focus. 
            when working with a client I will first create a few greyscale general themes. once they choose a theme, I will 
            produce more fine tuned greyscal designs. After one of these designs is chosen, I will iterate through a few 
            color designs until the end result is accomplished.

        <h2>Illustration</h2>
        <p>
            The following illustrations of mine show examples of light, atmospheric perspective,
             ambient occlusion, optical bloom, sub surface scattering, depth of field, the fresnel effect
            and other visual phenomena. Note that images 1,3, and 5 contain characters from exisitng commercial works 
            (Dungeon and Fighter, Made in Abyss and Guilty Gear respectively). All others are my original designs.

        <p>These pieces were created traditionally. Note that the portrait
            was drawn from reference.
